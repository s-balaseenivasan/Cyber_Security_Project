Note-Taking and To-Do Web Application
Overview:
This web application combines two essential productivity tools: a Note-Taking application and a To-Do List application, designed with a focus on security, usability, and user experience. It features secure user authentication, data encryption, and voice-assisted note creation.

Key Features:
Secure User Authentication:

The application utilizes SMTP Authentication for user registration and login processes. Users can securely create accounts or sign in using their email credentials, ensuring a safe and trusted environment for accessing personal data.
Note-Taking Application:

Voice-to-Text Functionality: Users can add notes using a speech-to-text feature, allowing for quick and hands-free note creation. This enhances accessibility and convenience, particularly for users on the go.
Content Management: Notes can be created, opened, updated, and managed effortlessly, ensuring that all important information is easily accessible and editable.
Data Security: All note content is encrypted using AES-128 encryption for both storage and retrieval. This guarantees that the data remains confidential and protected against unauthorized access.
To-Do List Application:

A straightforward To-Do List feature allows users to create and manage tasks effectively. While currently offering basic functionality, it is designed to be expanded with advanced features in future iterations.
Security Measures:
AES-128 Encryption: All data within the application, particularly sensitive information such as notes, is encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128). This provides a robust layer of security, ensuring both data privacy and integrity during storage and retrieval.
Secure Authentication via SMTP: By employing SMTP authentication for user access, the application ensures that all user credentials are verified and handled securely, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
Future Development:
Further enhancements are planned for the To-Do List functionality, including advanced task management features, collaboration capabilities, and integration with calendar applications to provide a more comprehensive productivity tool.
